i think the main problem is not your ability of implementing it. the problem is your approach of visulising 
this challenge

[12:52]  

it's pretty common. everyone in the class has this problem

[12:53]  

i appreciate your effort on this challenge

[12:55]  

for example your "renderCalendar" and "updateCalendar" -- what is the 
difference between them?

[12:56]  

what if renderCalendar only give you an empty datepicker and later on you 
feed data into it and it will figur out what to display :slightly_smiling_face:

[12:57]  

then from that point on you only have to change the data for diff month and feed it into your datepicker again.
[12:57]
this way you complete seperate the duty for data and the view

[12:57]  

try not to mix view element and data at "renderCalendar" stage

[12:58]  

you will find your life alot easier that
